# metroLineSimulation

The purpose of this C++ code is to simulate a basic metro system with multiple lines and trains. The program allows users to interact with and observe the movement of trains along predefined metro lines.  It serves as a basic example of a simulation program, demonstrating concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, data structures, and user interaction.
